# Fly-maybe app

Project using ML to predict flight delays for the next five days.
Weather data from NOAA and 2016 flight data from the 50 top airports in the USA
is used to predict if a flight is going to be delayed. The flight is classified in 4 different categories of increasing delay and hence issues caused to the traveller.

## Maps
Flight data is presented in two maps where the number of flights and the  ratio of delayed flights to total number of flights on the route.
